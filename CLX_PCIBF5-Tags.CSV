If equalistation pressure is off it is ok for the Pressurisation line to depressure closer to fully to lessen VF08 opening impact on the sintered plates. However, if equalisation is on, it is not wise to fully depressure the line as when VF08 is opened there is the potential for N2 to go from the IH to the pressurising line being at lower pressure if the check valves do not hold and then contaminating the pressurising line. Also the risk of VF08$'s from the other IH$'s in servce leaking will also cause an unwanted backflow. Accordingly a shorter depressure time is used to ensure the pressure line drops to somewhere a little above the equalised hopper pressure to soften the impact of opening VF08 onto the sintered plates.$NNote a comparison is done with pressure as sometimes even though equalisation is selected it may not have occured so a check on pressure is made to verify this.$N","MOV(PD_TMR_PrsLine_Depres_EqOn,A5_1_0VB10_Depr_Tmr.PRE)","121"

RCOMMENT,"MainProgram","SQ_PCSB_Fluidizing","P.Cugaly 8/7/16 --- This timer / rung has been added to ensure that when the fluidising sequence requires the fluidising valve 4 open (A4.1.2VBW4) that it will at least be open for the duration of the pulse timer below.$NWhat was occuring is that during an IH fill the sequence to fluidise is kicked off starting at Valve 4 on for 5s, off for 10s, Valve 3 on for 5s, off for 10s ...... then valve 2 then valve 1. If the IH is still filling when Valve 1 has closed it goes back around to start at valve 4. Sometimes the IH fill stops, which stops the fluidising sequence, when valve 4 has only been opened for a very short time. For some reason in this situation we get the limit switch lost alarm (found to be losing the closed LSW.....). For whatever reason the closed limit switch seems to bounce resulting in this alarm. By adding the rung below a minimum opening time is introduced to try to stop this bounce..... lets see if it works......  (It seems to be a nuisance alarm and there should be no issue of having a minimum opening time for auto only).","TON(PCugaly_Test_TMR[0],?,?)","28"
